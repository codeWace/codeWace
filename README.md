## 👋 About Me
- Hi, I’m **@codeWace** (Wajiha Tasaduq).  
- 👀 I’m interested in **coding** and **gaming stuff**.
- 🛠️ Turning Everyday Ideas into Apps. I enjoy taking simple, real-life needs and turning them into applications. 
  If something feels repetitive, inconvenient, or “there should be an app for this,” I try to build it.
- 🌱 Currently learning **Python**, **JavaScript**, **game development** (very much in “newbie loading…” mode), and **cybersecurity**. It’s a chaotic skill tree, but it’s working. 
- 🎮 I try to code games to understand how the world works (you could say **curiosity** is my default mode - I love exploring anything that makes me wonder.)
- 🌀 Also a huge Naruto fan, still waiting for my chakra to activate.
- ⚔️ Levi Ackerman-level efficiency enthusiast - eliminating bugs like titans.
- ⚡ Fun fact: **Ketchup was once sold as medicine**.
